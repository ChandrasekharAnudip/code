Encaptulation
	Mixture of fields and methods.
	
	Data Binding
	
	
	
	class
		fields
		methods

class Account {
	private int acc_id;
	private String name;
	
	public void setAccountID(int acc_id) {
		this.acc_id = acc_id;
	}
	
	
}


balance = 10000;
amount = 14000;

balance = balance - amount;

balance = 10000 - 14000
        = -4000

Abstraction
	We know there is something.
	We dont know what is that?

1. abstract  classes === > 0%  to 100% abstraction

	1. abstract method ==> the method without the body.
	
	2. if a class is defined with atleast one abstract method, that class can be called as an abstract class.
	
	3. We should not create any object for an abstract class. 
	
	4. Abstract class must be a base class.
	
	5. There must be atleast one derived class for an abstract class.
	
	6. In derived class(es) we must overide the abstract method(s) of the abstract class.
	
	
	

2. interfaces ===> 100% abstraction



sh1.draw();

public abstract class Shape {
	.
	.
	.
	.
	
	public abstract void area();
	
	public void hello() {
		s.o.p("Hello");
	}

}


Shape s = new Shape(); ==> this is an error because we cannot create object for abstract class.

s.hello();

s.area(); 

class Circle extends Shape {

	.
	.
	.
	.
	
	@Overide
	public void area() {
		double area = Math.PI * r * r;
	}
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {

	.
	.
	.
	.
	
	@Overide
	public void area() {
		double area = l * w;
	}
}
